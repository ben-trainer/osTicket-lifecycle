<h1>Resolving Tickets in osTicket</h1>
In this lab I go through the lifecycle of a ticket from the intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket. We will be creating and managing our own tickets for the purpose of demonstration. <br />

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
Now we will begin with our ticketing life cycle. First we must create our tickets which can be done by visiting the “localhost/osTicket/index” on our web browser. Select open ticket and fill out the request.

Once we have created our sample tickets they will appear in our tickets tab within our admin panel. Here I created a variety of tickets which need to be categorized based on priority and assign them to the correct professional.

Jane Doe (me) worked the ticket and assigned it to the System Administrator department, also setting the SLA level, and adjusted the Priority Level. The customers are also able to select the Help Topic to help the IT professionals categorize tickets better.

Here I resolve the issue, closing the ticket, and you can see the updated ticket here.

Jane Doe (me) reached out to John with a warm hand off. Now John Doe (me) received the ticket directly into his ticket queue. Where John Doe (me) was able to resolve it promptly.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

I learned of the use of SLAs in help desk positions, which can change the priority of a ticket, outside of its own categorized priority to uphold a specific company’s quotas. Building out a database like this from scratch helped me understand how valuable documentation is within a helpdesk environment regarding departments and who to assign tickets to. Ensuring concise clear communication between each other.

Strong communication is critical while resolving tickets, being clear and concise go a long way for you coworkers and customers. Tickets are coming in with very different or similar issues and should be assigned to the appropriate person or team. Jane was able to manage and resolve a ticket on her own quickly without the need to have John resolve it, lightening the load on John. This also shows the importance of documentation as the ticket was able to be resolved and another agent wouldn't accidentally work a ticket that is already done. The documentation can also be later used to fix the problem in the future, ensuring smoother operations within the company.
